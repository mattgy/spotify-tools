   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mattgy/spotify-tools.git
   cd spotify-tools
   ./spotify_run.py
   ```

2. **Set up Spotify credentials** (one-time):
   - Create a free app at [developer.spotify.com](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)  
   - Set redirect URI to: `http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback`
   - Use menu option 10 to enter your Client ID and Client Secret

3. **Start using the tools!** Everything else is automated.
