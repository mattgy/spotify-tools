Script to follow all artists in your Spotify playlists.
This script uses the Spotify Web API to:
1. Authenticate with your Spotify account
2. Fetch all playlists you've created
3. Extract unique artists from those playlists
4. Follow all those artists

Requirements:
- Python 3.6+
- spotipy library (pip install spotipy)
